## Why Quad9?

### Privacy by law

Quad9 will never log/record enduser IP addresses. Ever.

These are not just words on a website. As an organization based in Switzerland, Quad9 is bound by strict Swiss internet privacy laws.

### Security

When using Quad9's industry-leading threat blocking secure service (9.9.9.9), Quad9 will block DNS requests destined for domains associated with malicious intent, such as those associated with malware, viruses, adware, phishing, scams, etc.

### Encryption

Quad9 supports DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over DoH (DoH), and DNSCrypt.
