## Overview

Quad9 Connect is an Android application compatible with ChromeOS using the Google Play Store. It creates a secure tunnel between the device and Quad9 for sending DNS queries via DNS over Quad9 Connect provides additional features like a query log, one-click service switching, and the ability to report false positives from the Query Log.

Quad9 Connect is not a VPN, but uses the VPN functionality of the device to achieve encrypted DNS and the features associated with the application. When Quad9 Connect is enabled, it is not possible to use another VPN connection at the same time. If using a VPN, consider setting Quad9's DNS servers in the "Custom DNS" settings of your VPN client.
