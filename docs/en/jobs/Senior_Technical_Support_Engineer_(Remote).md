## About

**Submit Resumes to: [jobs@quad9.net](mailto:jobs@quad9.net)**

This is a Tier-2 or Tier-3 position for a full-time, Mid-to-Senior Technical Support Engineer (Remote - UTC-3 to UTC-5 - North/South Americas)

Quad9, a non-profit cybersecurity and privacy organization headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, is looking for a Tier-2 or Tier-3 Technical Support Engineer.

We are a small team that builds and operates one of the world's largest open recursive DNS resolvers, distributed in hundreds of locations worldwide in more than 100 nations. We incorporate cybersecurity as a standard part of our main offerings, and we have exceptionally high privacy standards to ensure user data is protected against observation and exploitation. The service is freely offered and our end users vary from individual users, hospitals, schools, small and mid-sized corporations, and ISPs with hundreds of thousands or millions of users.

Our mission is clear, and the team is cohesive and fast-moving. The speed of change is significant, and the technology in the DNS area is changing quickly and Quad9 drives some of that change. This position is on the edge of that interaction between our typically technically-savvy user community and the rest of the team, and is the translation point of policy, engineering, and operational activity.

The position reports to the General Manager, though daily tasking will be ticket-driven and interactions will be primarily horizontal with engineering, provisioning, or other staff.

## What you'll do

* Provide technical support in a ticketing system (no phone/chat support) to a global user base with varying degrees of technical aptitude.

* Replicate and troubleshoot DNS resolution and network issues on our network and in your own lab environment.

* Communicate with external networks and services to investigate and resolve issues which require mutual troubleshooting and analysis. IE: Authoritative DNS services, ISPs, CDNs.

* Perform basic threat analysis on domain names reported as false positives or false negatives in relation to Quad9's threat-blocking service.

* Learn and understand the Quad9 Anycast network and why and how ISPs route to a specific Quad9 PoP. Analyze "ASN paths'' (network routes) and flag unexpected results. 

* Manage public-facing documentation for accuracy and completeness in order to update or create content improvements on an as-needed basis.

* Monitor various mailing lists, reference sites, and keyword search platforms for issues involving Quad9 services, and identify/repair/explain issues or reference users to documentation.

* Be responsible for meeting ticket-driven basic KPIs for speed of responses, end-user satisfaction with answers, and improvement in documentation.

* Take assigned engineering tasks on as needed and as ticketing volume allows. Database cleanups, fault discovery, monitoring system improvement and review - there will be ad-hoc tasks that build your understanding of the systems and benefit the team and users.

* Get inspired and grow. DNS touches everything, and youâ€™ll have the opportunity to work in a wide spectrum of troubleshooting, as well as use your extra cycles to contribute in a way that best suits your interests, skills, and career goals. We expect people to learn in this role what we do and how we do it, and there are opportunities for growth within the organization based on skill growth and interests.

* Feel good about your work. Quad9 users are typically very appreciative of the support they receive. You'll be an appreciated hero to many, working for a highly respected, non-profit organization that helps millions of people for free every day.

## Position requirements

* Past experience with, and ability to describe fundamentals of DNS-related networking protocols (UDP, TCP, TLS, HTTPS) and troubleshooting tools (ping, traceroute, mtr, telnet, dig/nslookup, curl)

* Familiarity with Linux, SSH and a BASH environment.

* Familiarity with all desktop operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS) and mobile platforms (Android/iOS)

* Full Working Proficiency in English (CEFR Level: >=C1)

* Basic ability to take and read packet captures.

* You like helping people and solving puzzles.

* Available for 3, 1-hour meetings a week at approximately 15:00 UTC

* Available to attend an annual all-hands meeting, typically in Europe, for approximately 3-4 days per year.

* The position is entirely remote, but preferred applications will be located in a region in the UTC-3 to UTC-5 timezones of North/South America.


## Nice to Have

* Experience troubleshooting DNS.

* Knowledge of ECS and DNSSEC.

* Understanding of Anycast networks, BGP and the "AS cone"
