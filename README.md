# Consumer Routers

Due to the sheer amount of consumer-grade router makes, models, and variances in user interfaces between firmware versions, we will typically not add router-specific instructions.

Open-source router software (IPFire, OPNsense, pfSense, etc) is supported, since we can test in a lab environment with VMs and do not require physical access to a device.
